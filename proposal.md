# Major Project Proposal

## Description
- A primitive RTS game, similar to Starcraft and Red Alert.

## Needs To Have
- Smooth, functioning unit selection and command excecution(move, attack, build, etc.).
- Smooth pathfinding and battling system.
- Build buildings and train troops, spawning units without bugs.
- A currency and mining/money-making system.
- Basic UI, pixel-looking units are fine.
- Reasonable running efficiency, no lag with 100-200 units on both sides.

## Nice To Have
- Different types/classes of troops, such as air forces
- Combative buildings such as defense towers, or movable buildings like those of the Terran race in Starcraft.
- Heroes like those in Warcraft III.
- Graphics comparable or better than Starcraft I, without significantly taxing performance.
